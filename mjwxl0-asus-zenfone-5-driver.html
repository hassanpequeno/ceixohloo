                            <p> Hey guys, total n00b here: I need to install the following driver in my Asus Zenfone 2 (with Android 5). Any idea on how to do this? Driver: https://github.com/kshoji/USB-MIDI-Driver/tree/develop/MIDIDriver Thanks in advanced, any help is welcomed :) Cheers. PD: Not a native speaker sorry for the possible mistakes. Hello everyone, Recently I bought a Dualshock 4 v2 controller and Asus USB-BT400 Bluetooth adapter. With help of DS4Windows software my controller works fine when connected via USB, however I want to use it wirelessly and here is the problem. I was able to pair controller with the PC, but whenever I press a PS button on a controller it won't connect. Instead in Bluetooth settings I see Wireless Controller status constantly switching between "Paired" to "Connected", also in DS4Windows control. I have a pair of Sony MDR-EX155 Earbuds-or In-Ear Headphones. I bought them in November 2018 at Best Buy after the generic Asus earbuds that came with my Asus Zenfone 5Q broke (left earbud shorted out). Now I feel these are going to perish soon. There's a couple very small cracks in the 2nd outer layer of the Right earbud, only cosmetic for now but I feel it may wear off someday and expose the main wire, in which that may short out as I yank the wire out of these quite often. Might I have some Sony MDR-EX155 wired In-ear headphones that I've been using since November 2018 after the generic ones that came with my phone (Asus Zenfone 5Q) broke (one of the drivers shorted out). They sound great, I'm a basshead so in-ears for life! (Fuller sound, and more compact than on-ear) I'm hearing impaired, so I'm partially deaf but I can still use headphones fairly normal. I'm not deficient in any frequency (for now). But I just don't like on-ear for that matter (plus they don't. 
I'm looking for an external microphone that I can simply just plug into the headphone jack of my Asus Zenfone 5Q and not have to worry about any cables and shit. I don't talk in the recordings, it's just the music reproduced from crappy 1W drivers to 15" American woofers from Sanyo SSV16's. So it needs to cleanly reproduce the bass frequencies without breaking a sweat. The built in mic from my Asus sucks ass at it. Here's a sample: https://photos.app.goo.gl/685SDy9ikprMQAE4A (If unable to access. My previous post got removed, which is a shame, because it was very well-documented and every claim was proven by a link, but I assume it was too long, so let's try again with a more concise version. If you're looking for a more detailed version, stalk my post history. The hype around the Poco F1 is real and justified, but there are 4 main reasons why I think you should wait instead of buying it immediately: 1. The price is way too high right now in most countries I've been using the ASUS Zenfone Max Pro (M1), the 6 GB RAM variant for a little over a week now. Mostly very satisfied. Compared a lot with a Redmi Note 5 Pro that a friend owns. This phone excels in almost everything but the camera. The camera is no slouch tho. Very decent. I also enabled the Camera2 API via a fastboot (yes, without root) and Google Camera performance is just awesome. I'll post camera samples if anyone wants to see it. The battery performance is not that great

I'm currently using them with a Sherwood S-7900A, which does not play well with them compared to the Sanyo SSV16's used as front speakers. So I need something more appropriate for them. Short story - My brother got Xiaomi Redmi 6A (it is with android) for his birthday yesterday and it doesnt detect his razer kraken mobile. They work on the PC, work on Asus zenfone 5, LG G3 but the xiaomi doesnt detect them at all. Does he need any drivers ? Other headphones work properly. I doubt Razer support will answer me fast, and i didnt find anything in google search regarding drivers for razer. 
Hello fellow nexus5 users. I have been using the might nexus ever since its launch. Was my first phone and I have an insane amount of attachment to it. I learnt all about rooting and modding with the phone ! Main issue for me over the last 2 years have been the dismal battery life . after much pondering I just got myself the ASUS Zenfone max pro M1. Comes with a near stock experience and within my budget. Has two updates scheduled and project treble support which I hope allows GEARBEST Deals Compilation (5.11.2018)!

Hi guys, first time poster! Im posting this to ask your opinion on what smartphone should i consider for my next daily driver. Im only going to buy it in the end of the year, so this might still be too early but i want to start cutting out some options. Im currently rocking a Samsung S7 Edge, but the bezels are starting to annoy me, and it's battery is already starting to not hold an entire day. So, i was thinking of a new phone, with a max budget of around 500‚Ç¨. The options i am already. 
Greetings! Hope everyone had a great time with Golden Week, CM campaign and the recent cinfes! ( Be sure not to miss out the special gacha set if not done so yet! (https://redd.it/8fylxf) - Campaign last till June for old players!) Still hyped with Golden Week? Check out the latest CM for Starlight Stage here! (https://redd.it/8g6okm) --- #Background We opened the forth Device Survey two weeks ago, which we had everyone to pitch in to provide everyone a better Ok i hope you are already familiar with ADB & fastboot. Now here was the problem i faced. I had mi phone previously and i used fastboot mode most often. It worked fine. But when i connected Zenfone via fastboot it didn't respond. Well the drivers aren't same for different companies phones. Check the device manager. It might show Asus phone with ADB interface, if the drivers are fine then fastboot will work normally. Or else it'll show ‚ùó sign. Well you need to uninstall the drivers With everything that's happened with ZTE and everything that has been said by various parties, are you sticking with the company or even just the phone you have now? Are you patiently waiting for LOS 15.1 and are going to stick with that as your daily driver for a while? Or are you jumping ship and if so, which phone are you jumping to? I have to say that personally, despite the announcement of the OnePlus 6, I am going with the Asus Zenfone 5z. It's ticking all of the right boxes I recently bought some 1More Triple Driver earbuds. Their sound is great, but I'm having a problem with the in-line controller. I've done my best to find a solution, or at least someone who's had a similar problem, but no dice. My phone's an ASUS Zenfone AR (A002A) running Android 7.0. It has a standard 3.5mm jack, and I mainly use the earbuds for Spotify and Audible. The earbud controls are meant to be compatible with both iOS and Android phones. I downloaded the Headset Button. TxGov ( TxGov ( TxGov (http://onlinemanuals.txdot.gov/help/urlstatusgo.html?url=worldnews.easybranches.com/regions/malaysia/asus-rog-phone-unboxing-and-first-. I have installed lineage 14.1 onto the asus zenfone 2, but after flashing the os and everything I needed, it no longer detects the device storage in windows when the os is booted up. However, I can access the storage only when I am in the twrp recovery. I've tried everything from messing with drivers to clearing cache, but nothing has worked. Does anyone have an idea on what I should. I successfully was using LineageOS on my Zenfone 2 for awhile until I decided to mess with root and stuff further without sufficient knowledge. That's when I messed up my phone and now it only boots to Fastboot. Trying to enter "Normal Boot" or "Recovery" will only cause the phone to restart and return to only booting to Fastboot. The problem here is my (Windows 10) PC's ADB does NOT detect my device, only showing (null)device not found. However, my PC DOES detect my phone in the Device Manager. Downgraded to LP because the stock MM ROM is just crap. I used an official image from asus' site and installed it from within android. It all went well until it rebooted after install and it got stuck in the bootloader which at the same time won't go into recovery just reboots again back to the bootloader which looks like this (https://i.imgur.com/XET8d9b.jpg). The only difference is that if I press volume-up the screen sort of flashes and I get a real serial code. I tried this XDA tutorial. 
I've been using LineageOS 14.1 with TWRP on my Asus Zenfone 2 (Z00TD) for a while, it works perfecty aside from being unable to get it to be detected as a drive on my Windows 10 computer under any circumstances. I searched online and most people's issues were resolved after the following methods which I then tried: Enabled USB file transfer from the drop down after plugging the phone into my PC. Tried different USB cables & ports, made no difference. Enabled/Disabled USB debugging </p>
